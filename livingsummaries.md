# Architectural System Design (ASD)

## Goal / Vision
Develop a rigorous, evidence-grounded process to translate ambiguous organizational intent into safe, constrained, and explainable architectural plans that deliver measurable value inside real companies without requiring unsafe automation.

## Problem Statement
Most AI/architectural initiatives fail because they:
- Start from idealized goals without grounding in existing systems, workflows, constraints, and declared properties
- Introduce solutions before fully decomposing the decision space and risks
- Hide behind frameworks, vendors, or code instead of exposing reasoning
- Over-automate high-stakes decisions, creating unexplainable black boxes or increased risk
- Lack artifacts that build trust with stakeholders who must approve and own the outcome

## System / Approach
A structured, append-only "Living Intent & Decision Document" with 12 fixed sections:
1. Document Metadata – tracks sources, scope, assumptions
2. Stated Goal (Raw) – preserves original ambiguity
3. Observed Reality – facts only about current products, workflows, systems, roles, interfaces, SLAs, constraints
4. Problem Space – explicit, implicit, and anti-goals
5. Constraints & Non-Negotiables – hard (legal/security), organizational, evolution
6. Decision Surface Mapping – identifies all real decision points, triggers, owners, required info, and consequences
7. Risk & Failure Analysis – general and AI-specific failure modes, blast radius
8. Architectural Principles – derived and justified from problems/constraints/risks (e.g., AI advises but never commits, all decisions auditable)
9. Conceptual Architecture – functional domains, authority boundaries, information flow (no tech/vendor specifics)
10. Tradeoffs & Rejected Paths – explicit documentation of alternatives and why rejected
11. Final Plan – bounded changes, non-changes, measurements, human approval gates
12. Living Summary – concise rolling overview for stakeholders

The process is deliberately pre-solution, human-centered, and constraint-respecting.

## Implementation Notes
- Currently a mature template/process, not software
- Delivered as a Markdown-based "Living Document" (append-only, change-aware, periodically summarized)
- Designed to be used in consulting engagements or internal staff+ roles
- No code, frameworks, or vendors referenced by design
- Can hand off to SCIS formalization, engineering pilots, or governance review

## Metrics / Validation
- Stakeholder trust (qualitative feedback from CTO/hiring manager level)
- Ability to produce plans that are approved and implemented without major regression
- Reduction in ambiguous or risky automation proposals
- Successful use in interviews/engagements as evidence of organizational realism
- Measurable outcomes in real engagements: faster alignment, fewer rejected proposals, clearer risk visibility

## Observations / Lessons Learned
- Organizations deeply appreciate explicit constraint respect and risk surfacing over flashy solutions
- The "no tech in conceptual architecture" rule forces clearer thinking and builds more trust
- Decision Surface Mapping is the highest-leverage step—most value emerges here
- Explicitly documenting rejected paths dramatically increases perceived credibility
- The format works even with zero internal access; it signals safety and maturity

## Notes for LLM Use
- This is a process/methodology, not a built product or deployed system—never claim production use or code ownership
- Emphasize organizational value, constraint respect, risk management, and explicit reasoning
- Highlight that it enables safe AI integration without overreach
- When generating resume bullets, LinkedIn posts, or application materials: focus on architectural thinking, grounding in reality, and stakeholder trust-building

## Addendum: Reference-Anchored ASD Case Studies (Key Evolution to ASD Process)

### Goal / Vision (Updated)
Extend ASD into "Reference-Anchored ASD Case Studies" — public, falsifiable demonstrations of the ASD process applied to real, inspectable systems.  
Shift from generic or hypothetical examples to analyses that always start from publicly observable artifacts of existing companies, making the work credible, constrained, and differentiable.

### Problem Statement (Added Layer)
Previous ASD applications risked appearing generic or speculative because they:
- Lacked a visible, bounded starting point (real company + real artifacts)
- Allowed implicit invention of context
- Reduced differentiation — anyone can describe idealized processes without grounding
- Failed to demonstrate restraint and evidence-based reasoning in public

### System / Approach (Major Extension)
ASD now mandates a non-negotiable grounding phase before any problem decomposition or architectural reasoning.

Every ASD case study must follow this strict sequence:

1. **Reference System Definition (Grounding)**
   - Company: [Specific real company]
   - Artifacts Used: List of public URLs/references (docs, API reference, blog posts, compliance pages, job postings, etc.)
   - What Exists Today: Factual enumeration only (products, workflows, features, interfaces — no speculation)

2. **Observed System Properties**
   - Inferred guarantees and invariants required for the system to function as publicly described
   - Declared promises (SLAs, compliance, trust guarantees)

3. **Tension / Fracture Point**
   - Specific, observable mismatch or evolution pressure (e.g., introduction of AI into historically deterministic workflows)
   - Grounded in artifacts, not invented

4. **ASD Exploration (Core Process)**
   - Decision Surface Mapping
   - Risk & Failure Analysis (especially AI-specific)
   - Authority Boundaries (human vs system vs AI)
   - Architectural Principles derived from grounding

5. **Architectural Re-Expression**
   - Clarified decision map
   - Required observability/auditability
   - Safe evolution path respecting all constraints

6. **Optional Implementation Direction**
   - Only after full grounding and reasoning
   - Always downstream and secondary

This structure ensures:
- No design from "vibes" — only from existing reality
- Implicit systems are made explicit before any evolution is proposed
- All reasoning is anchored and falsifiable

### Implementation Notes
- Still a mature methodology/template, not software
- Case studies are produced as standalone Markdown documents or appended sections
- First candidates identified (Stripe, GitHub, Atlassian, ServiceNow, Zendesk, Salesforce, Shopify, Notion, Slack, Intercom)
- Process deliberately avoids internal access — proves value from public signals alone
- Designed to serve as portfolio artifacts, interview discussion pieces, and consulting deliverables

### Metrics / Validation (Updated)
- Ability to produce complete, grounded case studies that withstand public scrutiny
- Stakeholder/hiring manager feedback on demonstrated restraint and realism
- Differentiation in applications: "I don't propose solutions in a vacuum — here are public analyses showing how I think"
- Successful use of case studies to initiate conversations with target companies

### Observations / Lessons Learned (New)
- Grounding in real public artifacts eliminates the "generic consultant" perception
- Public companies with extensive documentation (Stripe, GitHub, Zendesk) are ideal — they expose decision complexity without needing NDAs
- Starting from fracture points created by AI introduction highlights ASD's unique value (safe integration without breaking guarantees)
- Explicit rejection of speculation builds far more trust than flashy but ungrounded proposals
- This approach mirrors how senior internal architects actually work: they inherit messy reality and must evolve it safely

### Notes for LLM Use
- When referencing ASD, always emphasize the mandatory grounding phase and reference-anchored case studies
- Never present ASD examples without naming a real company and specific public artifacts
- In resume bullets, LinkedIn posts, or applications: highlight "evidence-based architectural reasoning from public systems" and "restraint in automation proposals"
- If generating content, ask for clarification on which reference company to use if not specified
- Stress that this evolution makes ASD uniquely credible and enterprise-ready

2.
- If targeting consulting/strategy roles: stress how ASD bridges intent to implementable plans inside constrained enterprises
- Always acknowledge it is a template ready for real-world application rather than a completed deployment
