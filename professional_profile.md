# Professional Profile

This file grounds LLMs for tailoring resumes, cover letters, or applications. Focus on architectural thinking, rapid learning, and constraint-respecting designs. Do not invent details; ask if unclear.

## Background
- 5 years as Navy radar technician: Hands-on with complex systems, troubleshooting under pressure, and ensuring mission-critical reliability.
- <1 year in AI: Rapid self-taught via Q&A with LLMs; specialized in deterministic frameworks, anti-hallucination tools, and enterprise-safe AI integration.
- Transition focus: From hardware/tech ops to AI strategy/architecture, emphasizing quick domain mastery and prototype velocity (e.g., missile threat detection POC in 1 hour, quantum sim in <1 week).

## Key Skills
- **Architectural Design**: SCIS framework, decision mapping, risk analysis for safe AI systems.
- **Prototyping**: Python (PyQt6, etc.), modular code assembly, rapid POCs in defense/enterprise contexts.
- **AI Expertise**: LLM orchestration, SLM optimization, semantic control, embeddings for efficiency.
- **Soft Skills**: Systematic problem decomposition, constraint respect, clear documentation for teams/stakeholders.
- **Tools/Tech**: GitHub, JSON schemas, databases (SQLite), NLP (spaCy/NLTK), GUIs (Tkinter).

## Career Narrative (For Tailoring)
- For AI Strategy/Consulting Roles: "Seasoned systems thinker bridging military-grade reliability with cutting-edge AI; excels at grounding vague intent into implementable plans inside regulated environments."
- For Engineering/Prototyping Roles: "Rapid prototyper with a track record of building deterministic AI tools from concept to demo in hours/days; focuses on modular, auditable designs to minimize risk."
- General: "AI architect passionate about human-centered, explainable systems; leverages frameworks like SCIS to enable safe evolution in high-stakes sectors."

## Notes for LLM Use
- Tailor by role/company: Pull from tracking.md, match keywords (e.g., "enterprise AI" for Accenture).
- Emphasize velocity and realism: Highlight quick learning, no overclaims on production experience.
- Structure outputs: Use bullet points for resumes; narratives for letters; always include quantifiable wins (e.g., "POC in 1 hour").
- If missing info: Ask (e.g., "Need more on [skill]?").
