# LLM Reference Index

This is your canonical, LLM-grounded reference for projects, tracking, templates, and personal info. Use raw links for strict grounding in prompts — focus on one or a few at a time to stay token-efficient.

## About Me Files
These provide personal grounding for tailoring resumes, applications, or outreach.

- [Contact Info](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrTrentDaVinci/reference/main/contact.md)  
  Basic professional contact details and availability.  
  Public file for easy sharing; always confirm before using in outputs.

- [Professional Profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrTrentDaVinci/reference/main/professional_profile.md)  
  Detailed overview of experience, skills, and career narrative for customizing resumes and job materials.  
  Living document; use for LLM-guided tailoring to specific roles/companies.

## Project Overviews (Staged in livingsummaries.md)
Detailed summaries live in the staging file: [livingsummaries.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrTrentDaVinci/reference/main/livingsummaries.md). Below are brief descriptions and status/types for quick reference. Projects here will migrate to individual files as they mature.

1. **ASD**  
   A rigorous process to translate organizational intent into safe, explainable architectural plans grounded in reality.  
   Mature methodology; staging for potential prototype expansion.

2. **Golden SLM**  
   A self-improving local AI system using geometric embeddings and symbolic control for efficient performance.  
   Conceptual blueprint; ready for prototyping phases.

3. **Tag**  
   An icon-based discovery platform with AI agents for organizing and acting on information with privacy focus.  
   Architecture defined; staging for implementation starting with core components.

4. **System Design Decision Framework**  
   A modular methodology for designing and evolving software architectures with JSON-driven validation.  
   v1.0 in use; v2.0 designed and slated for Q1 2026 implementation.

5. **Email Routing**  
   An auditable system for processing emails under regulatory and policy constraints with multi-phase decisions.  
   Conceptual architecture; validated against real cases and ready for prototyping.

6. **Document Processing**  
   An architecture for querying large documents while preserving structure and citations using multi-DB validation.  
   Framework proven; domain-specific elements implemented and staging for full integration.

7. **SCIS**  
   A deterministic framework declaring all software aspects explicitly for human-LLM collaboration without ambiguity.  
   Foundational principles applied across projects; mature and in active use.

8. **Program Builder**  
   A deterministic code assembly system using external LLMs for intent and SLMs for mechanical building with validation.  
   In development as a Python desktop app; SCIS-compliant with defined cycles.

9. **(Untitled Placeholder)**  
   Reserved for emerging ideas or refinements.  
   Early staging; no details yet — append to livingsummaries.md as needed.

## Individual Project Files (Mature Projects)
As projects graduate from staging, they'll get dedicated files here (e.g., in /projects/ folder). Add raw links as you create them.

- [ASD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrTrentDaVinci/reference/main/projects/asd.md) (Placeholder — migrate from staging when ready)

- [Golden SLM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrTrentDaVinci/reference/main/projects/golden_slm.md) (Placeholder)

(Repeat placeholders for others as needed — replace with real links/content when split.)

## Other Core Files
- [Company & Role Tracking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrTrentDaVinci/reference/main/tracking.md) – Tracks target companies, roles, fit reasons, and strategies for LLM-assisted applications.
- [Project Templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrTrentDaVinci/reference/main/template.md) – Structures for generating resumes, posts, profiles; enforces grounded outputs.
