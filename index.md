# LLM Reference Index

This is your canonical, LLM-grounded reference for projects, tracking, and templates. Use raw links for strict grounding in prompts.

## Project Overviews
Detailed summaries live in [livingsummaries.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrTrentDaVinci/reference/main/livingsummaries.md). Below are brief descriptions and status/types for quick reference:

1. **ASD**  
   Develop a rigorous, evidence-grounded process to translate ambiguous organizational intent into safe, constrained, and explainable architectural plans that deliver measurable value inside real companies without requiring unsafe automation.  
   Mature methodology template, not implemented as software; designed for consulting engagements.

2. **Golden SLM**  
   A locally-runnable, self-improving AI system that uses geometric token embeddings, symbolic semantic control, algorithmic specialization, and persistent memory to achieve 13B model performance at 1.5B cost through mathematical structure and experience-based evolution.  
   Conceptual blueprint in planning phase, with future prototype potential.

3. **Tag**  
   A dual-version, user- and AI-centric discovery and planning platform that combines icon-based workflows, RGB-coded tags, knowledge graphs, AI agents, and multi-medium accessibility to empower users, creators, and power players to discover, organize, and act on structured and semi-structured information with full control, privacy, and clarity.  
   Concept & architecture definition complete; positioned for phased implementation beginning with personal DB, icon workflows, and knowledge graph foundations.

4. **System Design Decision Framework**  
   A structured, change-aware methodology for designing, validating, and evolving software system architectures, with v2.0 transforming from large monolithic documents into a modular, JSON-driven, dependency-aware system optimized for LLM interaction, team collaboration, and automated validation.  
   v1.0 complete and in active use; v2.0 design complete, implementation planned for Q1–Q2 2026.

5. **Email Routing**  
   A systematic, enterprise-grade approach to processing incoming emails according to complex regulatory, confidentiality, escalation, and time-sensitive policies through explicit, auditable, multi-phase decision processes that preserve context, prevent assumptions, and provide verifiable compliance trails.  
   Conceptual architecture defined; methodology validated against real enterprise failures; suitable for phased prototyping and controlled rollout.

6. **Document Processing**  
   A systematic architecture for processing, querying, and validating large digital documents while preserving full structural integrity, cross-references, and precise page citations, transforming them into structured, auditable, queryable organizational assets using multi-database architecture, multi-system validation, and context-aware retrieval.  
   Architecture validated; multi-system validation framework proven; domain-specific processing implemented; RAG-based query model established.

7. **SCIS**  
   A deterministic, map-first software framework where all structure, behavior, metrics, and evolution are explicitly declared, role-bounded, and phase-locked, enabling humans and LLMs to design, build, support, reconstruct, and evolve software without guessing, scanning, or loss of intent.  
   Mature framework underpinning multiple projects; implemented as foundational principles for software construction and safety.

8. **Program Builder**  
   A deterministic software construction system where external LLMs design intent, a non-creative SLM mechanically assembles code from RGB building blocks with embedded rules, and Agent Matrices validate both specification and output—ensuring correctness, safety, and repeatability by design.  
   Python desktop application (PyQt6 GUI) implementing SCIS principles; in development with validation and assembly cycles defined.

9. **(Untitled Placeholder)**  
   Placeholder only; no detailed content available yet.  
   No status/type defined yet; awaiting project details.
