## ProgramBuilder (PB) — Hybrid LLM–SLM Software Assembly System

### One-Sentence Definition
ProgramBuilder (PB) is a deterministic software construction system where external LLMs design intent, a non-creative SLM mechanically assembles code from RGB building blocks with embedded rules, and Agent Matrices validate both specification and output—ensuring correctness, safety, and repeatability by design.

---

### System Identity
- **Name:** ProgramBuilder (PB)
- **Type:** Python desktop application (PyQt6 GUI)
- **Role:** Automated software assembly from structured specifications
- **Foundation:** SCIS 4.x (maps-first, ID-based, deterministic)
- **Core Insight:** Design is creative; assembly must not be

---

### Core Philosophy
PB enforces a strict separation of concerns:

- **External LLMs** design *what* should be built
- **Users** approve intent and fixes
- **SLM Orchestrator** assembles *how* it is built — mechanically
- **Agent Matrices** validate structure and correctness
- **PB** executes, tests, reports, and applies approved fixes

At no point is creative reasoning allowed inside the assembly engine.

---

### High-Level Flow
External LLM + User  
→ Design **Development Summary (DS)** using RGB references  
→ **Agent Matrix 1** validates DS structure & rule inheritance  
→ **SLM Orchestrator** assembles code with enforced rules  
→ **Agent Matrix 2** validates generated code  
→ **Testing**  
→ Success or controlled fix cycle

---

### Key Innovation: Rules Embedded in RGBs
PB’s defining breakthrough is **rule inheritance via RGB selection**.

- Every RGB represents an atomic code element
- Each RGB carries **embedded enforced rules**
- Selecting an RGB automatically inherits its rules
- Rules do **not** need to be manually listed in the DS
- Only *overrides* (extended rules only) may be specified

This eliminates forgotten rules, hallucinated constraints, and implicit assumptions.

---

### RGB System
- **RGB (0–255)** = atomic code element
- **Four Zones:**
  - 0–63: Commands / Meta
  - 64–127: Keywords & structural syntax
  - 128–191: Pre-assembled components
  - 192–255: Utilities & auxiliaries
- Each RGB includes:
  - Code template
  - Parameters
  - Embedded rules (core / extended)
  - Validation stage

RGBs are the *only* building blocks SLM may use.

---

### Development Summary (DS)
PB consumes a strict **11-section Development Summary**, which defines:

- Project metadata
- Dependencies
- SCIS phase/file structure
- Component definitions (via RGB lists)
- Dependency graph
- Build order
- Validation & testing requirements
- Mandatory components
- Final metadata & checksums

The DS specifies **intent**, not assembly instructions.

---

### Rule System
#### Core Rules (🔒)
- Safety-, correctness-, and security-critical
- Never configurable
- Always enforced

#### Extended Rules (⚙️)
- Quality, style, or project-specific
- Configurable via DS Section 1
- May be auto-applied by SLM

Rules are enforced based on:
- Their declared role
- Their declared validation stage
- Their RGB origin

---

### Agent Matrix Architecture
#### Agent Matrix 1 — Specification Validator
Validates:
- DS structure and JSON integrity
- RGB existence and zone correctness
- Automatic rule inheritance
- Allowed rule overrides (extended only)
- SCIS coordinates and component IDs
- Dependency integrity and mandatory components

Rejects invalid specs before assembly begins.

#### Agent Matrix 2 — Code Validator
Validates:
- Python syntax
- All inherited rules
- Core rule compliance
- Extended rule compliance (per mode)
- Naming, indentation, security, structure
- Alignment with DS intent

Reports violations with **RGB + rule context**.

---

### SLM Orchestrator (Inside PB)
The SLM is **mechanical by design**.

**It DOES:**
- Fetch RGB templates and embedded rules
- Substitute parameters
- Auto-generate docstrings, headers, markers
- Enforce indentation, naming, imports
- Validate syntax
- Apply allowed rule overrides

**It NEVER:**
- Chooses RGBs
- Designs logic
- Adds features
- Overrides core rules
- Makes architectural decisions

---

### Build–Test–Fix Cycle
1. External LLM designs DS
2. Agent Matrix 1 validates spec
3. SLM assembles code
4. Agent Matrix 2 validates output
5. PB runs tests
6. If failure:
   - Error reports include RGB + rule origin
   - User + LLM design a fix spec
   - Cycle repeats deterministically

---

### Determinism Guarantees
PB guarantees:
- No hallucinated rules
- No implicit structure
- No unsafe edits
- No creative assembly
- No silent failures

Given the same DS and RGB database, PB produces the same result.

---

### User Interface (PyQt6)
- Section-based DS input
- Validation and assembly progress
- Rule inheritance visibility
- Error reports with copyable RGB/rule context
- Session resume and auto-save

The GUI is an observability surface, not a decision-maker.

---

### Relationship to SCIS
- PB **implements SCIS principles**
- SCIS defines structure, phases, IDs, and determinism
- PB is the **execution engine** for SCIS-compliant software construction
- Agent Matrices act as SCIS enforcement points

PB cannot violate SCIS by design.

---

### Strategic Role
ProgramBuilder is not a code generator.

It is a **deterministic compiler of intent**, designed so that:
- LLMs can participate safely
- Humans retain authority
- Software can be rebuilt, audited, and evolved without loss of meaning

PB turns SCIS from theory into an operational system.
